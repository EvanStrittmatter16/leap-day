## Projects

I am a Junior undergraduate student at Yale University. Ever since I got my hands on my first Arduino I have been passionate about engineering projects. Here are my proudest creations

### Control of a Robotic arm


### Inductance modeling of an IC in COMSOL at EPC

Over the 2022 Summer, I work at EPC - a semiconductor Company in Los Angeles. A large application of their transistor parts is in Lidar technology as GaN is especially suited for quick switches between forward and reverse biasing. This makes it optimal for Lidar Technology as it means the LED can be activated in high-frequency short bursts, providing accurate readings in quickly adapting environments. EPC sells complete ICs for this circuit, with the limiting factor on the chips being their inductivity. High inductance resists changes in current, even generating a secondary voltage wave in the chip. My job was to model the inductance in the chip in COMSOL to identify regions in the geometry that contribute strongly to the total inductance of the chip, to help find an optimal design. I developed a modeling procedure, as well as tested it on several different designs, to provide the team with insights into promising geometry structures, as well as a method for testing future developments.

### Publications/Talks

### Comunities I care about
Consider cutting this as well unless ... (can replace with something like "Places I care about" and then put in float, code haven, YOSE, Soccer boys)

Beyond my own projects, I also care about my impact on my community. Much in the same way, I was inspired to pursue a career in robotics by working with and learning from my parents, mentors, and teachers. Their enthusiasm for creative problem-solving, purveyed through all aspects of science and influenced me in a positive way. Realizing this I have worked with several community groups throughout my life. 

#### YOSE
The first of such groups was a volunteer organization founded by one of my good friends in high school. The goal: to inspire joy in underprivileged children in the LA area in fields of science. Volunteers would leads the kids on short hikes in the Angeles Crest mountain range, or through the tide pools at beaches, imparting both a passion for nature and facts about the local wildlife in the area.

#### Code Haven
I continued volunteering with the same kind of project at Yale. The Club Code Haven has a similar goal: again working with underprivileged kids, now in the New Haven school system, working to inspire interest in Computer Science. Here we volunteered in a classroom, working with small groups of 3-4 students on a guided project in Scratch of their choosing. My group each created a “Space Invaders” clone where they could blast falling asteroids out of the sky. Every Friday we would meet and work on new aspects of the project, starting first with making a custom character, all the way up to object collisions and iterative code. It was gratifying getting to see the kids playing with their own finished creations by the end of the school year. 

#### South Pasadena Tournament of Roses
Another volunteering community I have enjoyed participating in is the South Pasadena Tournament of Roses. This group centers around constructing the South Pasadena (my hometown) City float. Here I’ve gotten to work on my welding skills as well as getting myself and my brother involved in a community of engineers. I really enjoyed getting to work with my brother on such a large-scale project, watching it drive through Pasadena at the start of the new year and pointing out to my family what parts we had worked on was special.
